\abstract{
A fail-prone system captures assumptions about which processes may fail together during an execution of a distributed system.
It is a useful tool for the design of distributed algorithms because a fail-prone system determines a canonical quorum system that, assuming it satisfies a property referred to as $Q^3$, allows to solve tasks such as reliable broadcast and consensus despite failures that remain within the assumptions.
However, fail-prone systems are not adapted to permissionless networks, where processes have no way to agree on failure assumptions beforehand.
In this paper, we propose federated fail-prone systems, which generalize fail-prone systems and are adapted to representing failure assumptions made by processes in a permissionless network.
Moreover, we show that, under a generalization of property $Q^3$, a federated fail-prone system determines a canonical quorum system allowing to solve tasks such as reliable broadcast and consensus despite failures that remain within the assumptions.

\section{Introduction}

A common problem in a distributed system is to solve a task (e.g.\ consensus) given some assumption about the possible failures that may occur.
In this paper, we consider Byzantine failures, where a process that fails behaves arbitrarily from then on.
We are interested in assumptions about failures described by a fail-prone system~\cite{malkhiByzantineQuorumSystems1998}, also called adversary structure~\cite{hirtPlayerSimulationGeneral2000}.
A fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}=\left\{F_1,...,F_n\right\}$ is a set of fail-prone sets, where, for every $i$, the fail-prone set $F_i$ is a subset of processes.
An execution satisfies the assumption described by $\mathcal{F}$ when the set of processes that fail during the execution is a subset of one of the fail-prone sets; we call such an execution a fail-compatible execution.

To devise an algorithm that tolerates the failures described by a fail-prone system, one usually uses a quorum system for $\mathcal{F}$.
A quorum system for $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of quorums, which are sets of processes, such that:% (a) the intersection of two quorums is not a subset of a fail-prone set and (b) for every fail-prone set $F$, there is a quorum disjoint from $F$.
% This guarantees two crucial properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[Consistency] In every fail-compatible execution, every two quorums have a non-faulty member in common.
  \item[Availability] In every fail-compatible execution, there is at least one quorum that is exclusively non-faulty.
\end{itemize}
Given a quorum system satisfying the Consistency and Availability properties, there are well-known algorithms for solving problems such as reliable broadcast or consensus.

Given a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}$, Hirt and Maurer~\cite{hirtPlayerSimulationGeneral2000} show that, if no three fail-prone sets cover the whole system, a property called Property $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$, then there exists a canonical quorum system $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ for $\mathcal{F}$.\footnote{Hirt and Maurer also show that if $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ does not hold, then there exists no quorum system for $\mathcal{F}$.}, where a set $Q$ is a quorum whenever $Q$ is the complement of a fail-prone set.

% Thus, given assumptions about failures formalized in a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $Q^3\left(\mathcal{F}\right)$, $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ is a natural quorum system to use to solve tasks such as reliable broadcast and consensus.
% For example, consider a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}_4$ consisting of 4 process where every singleton set is a fail-prone set (i.e.\ in every execution, at most one process fails).
% By definition, the quorums of the canonical quorum system for $\mathcal{F}_4$ are all the sets of processes of cardinality 3.

Fail-prone system model the situation in which all processes make the same failure assumptions about the whole system.
This is not realistic in a permissionless system, where processes do not generally know what the set of participants is and each process has a potentially different, partial view of the system.
% One issue with the notion of fail-prone system is that it is not very useful in permissionless systems.
% In a permissionless system, processes do not generally know what the set of participants is, and each process has a potentially different, partial view of the system.
Thus, it does not make sense for processes to (a) to all make the same assumptions and (b) make assumptions about the entire system.
For example, in a permissionless system, a fail-prone system where processes assume that less than some threshold $t=1/3$ of the system will fail does not yield a useful canonical quorum system: a quorum is a set of more than $n(1-t)=2n/3$ processes, where $n$ is the total number of processes, but there is no way for processes to determine $n$.
In recent work, Cachin and Tackmann~\cite{cachinAsymmetricDistributedTrust2019} propose Asymmetric Fail-Prone Systems which address point (a) above, but not point (b).

In this paper, we make the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    We propose \emph{federated fail-prone systems}, which generalize fail-prone systems and are adapted to the permissionless setting.
    Crucially, in a federated fail-prone system, each process (a) makes its own, personal failure assumptions and (b) makes failure assumptions only about a subset of the system.
  \item
    We show that given a federated fail-prone system satisfying a generalization of property $Q^3$, there is a canonical quorum system that satisfies generalize Availability and Consistency properties that are sufficient to solve reliable broadcast or consensus.
    The canonical quorum system that we obtain is an instance of a Federated Byzantine Quorum System as defined by Mazi√®res~\cite{MazieresStellarConsensusProtocol2015} and used in the Stellar Network to solve consensus.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Federated Fail-Prone Systems}
\label{sec:basic}

We consider a set of processes $\mathcal{P}=\left\{p_1,...,p_n\right\}$ in a message-passing system with Byzantine failures.
We assume that processes do not know $\mathcal{P}$.
% Instead, each process $p_i$ knows and trusts a subset $T_i$ of the participants and makes failure assumptions about $T_i$ using a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}_i$ over $T_i$ (i.e.\ $\mathcal{F}_i\subseteq 2^{T_i}$).
Instead, each process $p_i$ trusts a subset $T_i$ of the participants.
However, $p_i$ trusts members of $T_i$ only to the extent that they do not fail, and $p_i$ makes assumptions about those failures using a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}_i$ over $T_i$, which is a set of subsets of $T_i$ (i.e.\ $\mathcal{F}_i\subseteq 2^{T_i}$) that represents the subsets of $T_i$ that $p_i$ thinks can fail together in an execution.
We say that the array $\mathbb{F}=\left[\left(T_1,\mathcal{F}_1\right),...,\left(T_n,\mathcal{F}_n\right)\right]$ that associates to each process $p_i$ a set of known peers $T_i$ and a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}_i$ over $T_i$ is a federated fail-prone system.
We now consider a fixed federated fail-prone system $\mathbb{F}$.


% That is, in a given execution, a process is either well-behaved or faulty, and a faulty process can behave arbitrarily (including not taking steps).
% Processes do not know in advance which processes are well-behaved and which are not.
% We also assume that processes have a way to broadcast messages, and that a message broadcast by a well-behaved process is eventually delivered to all well-behaved processes.

% We capture the processes' assumptions about failures using the notion of \emph{federated fail-prone system}.
% A federated fail-prone system is an array $\mathbb{F}=\left[\left(T_1,\mathcal{F}_1\right),...,\left(T_n,\mathcal{F}_n\right)\right]$ that associates to each process $p_i$ a set of known peers $T_i$ and a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}_i$ over $T_i$.

We say that a process that does not fail during an execution is well-behaved in that execution, and otherwise it is faulty.
We say that an execution in which the failure assumptions of every well-behaved process are satisfied is a fail-compatible execution.
In other words, a fail-compatible execution is an execution in which, for every process $p_i$ that does not fail, the members of $p_i$'s trusted set that fail are a subset of one of $p_i$'s fail-prone sets.
Moreover, we say that a set $A$ such that, for every process $p_i$ in $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$, there exists $F\in\mathcal{F}_i$ such that $T_i\cap A \subseteq F$, is a fail-compatible set.
Thus, a fail-compatible execution is an execution in which the set of processes that fail is fail-compatible.
% More succinctly, if $A$ is the set of processes that fail during the execution, then, for every process $p_i$ in $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$, there exists $F\in\mathcal{F}_i$ such that $T_i\cap A \subseteq F$.
%More formally, the assumptions of the processes in a set $P$ are satisfied in an execution if and only if the set of processes that actually fail is a set $A$ such that, for every process $p_i$ in $P$ that does not fail (i.e.\ $p_i\not\in A$), there exists $F\in\mathcal{F}_i$ such that $T_i\cap A \subseteq F$.
% We say that such an execution is a fail-compatible execution, and that the set $A$ is fail-compatible.
% Finally, a fail-compatible system is a set of execution that are all fail-compatible.

Given a federated fail-prone system, we would like to obtain a quorum system that enables solving problems such as reliable broadcast and consensus in fail-compatible executions.
Since processes each make their own failure assumptions, we consider quorum systems in which each process has its own set of quorums, as formalized in federated quorum systems.
A federated quorum system $\mathbb{Q}$ is an array $\left[\mathcal{Q}_1,...,\mathcal{Q}_n\right]$ where, for every process $p_i$, $\mathcal{Q}_i$ is a quorum system over $\mathcal{P}$ (i.e.\ $Q_i\subseteq 2^{\mathcal{P}}$).
We generalize the Consistency and Availability to federated quorum system as follows. %it must satisfy at least the Availability and Consistency properties below.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[Consistency] In every fail-compatible execution, for every two non-faulty processes $p_i$ and $p_j$, for every two quorums $Q_i$ of $p_i$ and $Q_j$ of $p_j$, $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ have a non-faulty member in common.
  \item[Availability] In every fail-compatible execution, every non-faulty process $p_i$  has at least one quorum that is exclusively non-faulty.
\end{itemize}

In the next section, we consider the problem of defining a condition $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ that guarantees that we can define a quorum system for $\mathcal{F}$ that satisfies the Availability and Consistency properties. % sufficient to implement e.g.\ reliable broadcast.
However, since our goal is for our construction to be useful in permissionless systems, we do not want to require that processes' trusted sets intersect, or some other pairwise condition on processes' fail-prone systems, as that would mean that a process that joins the system has to synchronize with every other process already in the system.
% So, two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$ may have disjoint trusted sets, i.e.\ nothing prevents that $T_i\cap T_j=\emptyset$.
Thus, a naive approach consisting of defining the quorums of a process $p_i$ as the sets of the form $T_i\setminus F$, where $F\in\mathcal{F}_i$, would not work because, in the resulting federated quorum system, the quorums of different processes may be disjoint.

\section{Property \texorpdfstring{$Q^3$}{Q\textasciicircum 3} and the Canonical Federated Quorum System}

% Our goal in the rest of this section is to define a property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ and a canonical quorum system $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$ such that if $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ holds then $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$ satisfies the Availability and Consistency properties.

% Observe that, given a fail-compatible execution, for every process $p_i$, there is a fail-prone set $F$ of $p_i$ such that $T_i\setminus F$ does not fail.
% We call such a set a slice of $p_i$, i.e.\ a set of processes $S$ is a slice of $p_i$ if and only if there exists a fail-prone set $F$ of $p_i$ such that $S=T_i\setminus F$.
% The notion of slice is important because, in a fail-compatible system, if processes all broadcast, it is guaranteed that every process eventually hears from a set of processes $Q$ such that every member of $Q$ has a slice $S\subseteq Q$ (because $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$ is such a quorum).
% However, failed nodes can lie about their config...

In this section, we define property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ for federated fail-prone systems and a canonical federated quorum system that satisfies the Availability and Consistency properties if $\mathbb{F}$ satisfies $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$.

We start with a few preliminary definitions.
Given a process $p_i$ and $F\in \mathcal{F}_i$, we say that the set $P_i\setminus F$ is a slice of $p_i$.
Note that, in a fail-compatible execution, every process that does not fail can count on one of its slices to be well-behaved.
Define a slice choice $\mathcal{S}$ as an array $\left[S_1,...,S_n\right]$ of slices, where, for every $i$, $S_i$ is a slice of $p_i$.
Define a slice-choice graph $G$ as a directed graph whose nodes are processes and such that there exists a slice choice $\left[S_1,...,S_n\right]$ such that, for every $p_i$ and $p_j$, there is an edge from $p_i$ to $p_j$ whenever $p_j\in S_i$. Note that a slice-choice array determines a slice-choice graph and vice versa.

Given a graph $G$ and a vertex $v$, we write $G^*(v)$ for set of vertices reachable in $G$ from $v$. Moreover, if $A$ is a subset of the vertices of $G$, we write $G-A$ for the graph obtained by removing from $G$ all edges that have an endpoint in $A$.

% Given a slice choice $\mathcal{S}=\left[S_1,...,S_n\right]$ and a set of processes $P$, we say that $P$ is closed under $\mathcal{S}$ if, for every $p_i$ in $P$, $S_i$ is a subset of $P$.

% Let $G_\mathbb{F}^*$ be the transitive closure of $G_\mathbb{F}$, i.e. $G_\mathbb{F}^*(p_i)$ is the set of processes reachable from $p_i$ in $G_\mathbb{F}$.

%Given the above preliminary definitions, we now define property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ for federated fail-prone systems.
\begin{definition}[Property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$]
  Property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ holds if and only if for every two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$, for every two slice-choice graphs $G_i$ and $G_j$, for every fail-compatible set $A$ where $p_i\not\in A$ and $p_j\not\in A$, the set of vertices reachable from $p_i$ in $G_i-A$ intersects the set of vertices reachable from $p_j$ in $G_j-A$ (i.e.\ $\left(G_i-A\right)^*(p_i)$ and $\left(G_j-A\right)^*(p_j)$ intersect).
\end{definition}

Informally, Property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ says that two processes can always transitively hear from a third common process despite any failures compatible with the failure assumptions of well-behaved processes.
We now define the canonical federated quorum system for a federated fail-prone system $\mathbb{F}$.

\begin{definition}[Canonical federated quorum system for $\mathbb{F}$]
  \label{def:canonical}
  Given a federated fail-prone system $\mathbb{F}$, we define the canonical federated quorum system $\overline{\mathbb{F}}=\left[\mathcal{Q}_1,...,\mathcal{Q}_n\right]$ such that the set $\mathcal{Q}_i$ of quorums of $p_i$ is the biggest set such that, for every $Q\in\mathcal{Q}_i$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $p_i$ has a slice that is a subset of $Q$, and
    \item there exists a fail-compatible set $A$ such that, for every process $p\in Q\setminus A$, $p$ has a slice that is a subset of $Q$.\mytodo{This does not work; quorums depend on the execution, i.e.\ the scope of the quantification on $A$ is wrong.}
      \label{item:canonical_2}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

%Note that if we identify the notion of slice with the notion of quorum slice of Mazi√®res~\cite{MazieresStellarConsensusProtocol2015}, then the definition of quorums above coincides with Mazi√®res' definition; thus a Federated Byzantine Quorum System, as defined by Mazi√®res, is isomorphic to a canonical federated quorum system for some $\mathbb{F}$.

\begin{claim}
  \label{thm:canonical}
  If $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ holds, then the canonical federated quorum system for $\mathbb{F}$ satisfies the Availability and Consistency properties.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a fail-compatible execution and let $A$ be the set of processes that fail during the execution.

  Let us first show that $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$ satisfies the Availability property.
  We must show that every process has a quorum that is exclusively non-faulty.
  By definition of fail-compatible execution, every process $p_i$ that does not fail has a slice $S_i$ that is disjoint from $A$.
  Thus, by definition of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$, $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$ is a quorum of every process in $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$.
  By definition of $A$, $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$ is exclusively non-faulty, and thus every process has a quorum that is exclusively non-faulty.
  Note that we have not used the assumption that $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ holds, and thus Availability holds regardless of whether $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ holds.

  Let us now show that $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$ satisfies the Consistency property.
  Consider two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$, a quorum $Q_i$ of $p_i$, and a quorum $Q_j$ of $p_j$.
  We must show that $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ have a well-behaved member in common (i.e.\ a common member in $\mathcal{P}\setminus A$).
  By definition of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$, for every quorum $Q$ of $p_i$, there exists a slice-choice array $\mathcal{S}_Q=\left[S_Q^1,...,S_Q^n\right]$ such that, for every $p_k\in Q$, $S_Q^k\subseteq Q$.\mytodo{No. It's $p_k\in Q\setminus A$ for some $A$}
  Similarly, for every quorum $Q'$ of $p_j$, there exists a slice-choice array $\mathcal{S}_{Q'}=\left[S_{Q'}^1,...,S_{Q'}^n\right]$ such that, for every $p_k\in Q'$, $S_{Q'}^k\subseteq Q'$.
  Now consider the slice-choice graphs $G_Q$ and $G_{Q'}$ corresponding to $\mathcal{S}_Q$ and $\mathcal{S}_{Q'}$, respectively.
  By Property~$Q^3(\mathcal{F})$, we obtain that the set of vertices reachable from $p_i$ in $G_Q-A$ intersects the set of vertices reachable from $p_j$ in $G_{Q'}-A$.
  Moreover, observe that the set of vertices reachable from $p_i$ in $G_Q-A$ is a subset of $Q$.
  Similarly, observe that the set of vertices reachable from $p_j$ in $G_{Q'}-A$ is a subset of $Q'$.
  Thus, we conclude that $Q$ and $Q'$ have a well-behaved member in common.
\end{proof}

Note that, because of~\Cref{item:canonical_2} in the definition of $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$, the set of quorums of a process $p_i$ depends on the slices of other processes, which $p_i$ has no way to determine precisely in a permissionless setting because (a) $p_i$ does not know of all other processes and (b) faulty processes can lie about their slices.
Surprisingly, we show in~\cref{sec:learning} that, in practice, processes can dynamically learn about enough of their quorums.

\section{Learning about Quorums}
\label{sec:learning}

As we noted in~\Cref{sec:basic}, in the canonical quorum system, the set of quorums of a process $p_i$ depends on the slices of other processes.
In practice, $p_i$ does not know a priori the slices of other processes, but $p_i$ can learn about the slices of a process $p_j$ if $p_j$ tells $p_i$ what its slices are.
However, $p_i$ has no way to determine the slices of all other processes because (a) in a permissionless system, $p_i$ does not know of all other processes and (b) faulty processes can lie about their slices or stay silent.

We now introduce the notion of effective quorum in order to differentiate a process's quorums in $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$, and a quorum that the process learns of at runtime using the self-declared slices of other processes.

\begin{definition}
  An effective quorum of $p_i$ is a set $Q$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $p_i$ has a slice that is a subset of $Q$, and
    \item according to the information received by $p_i$ from other processes, every member of $Q$ has a slice that is a subset of $Q$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

What matters is that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[Consistency'] Even if failed processes lie about their slices, in a fail-compatible execution, the effective quorums of two well-behaved processes have a well-behaved member in common.
  \item[Availability'] Given sufficient communication, a well-behaved process learns about an effective quorum that is entirely well-behaved.
\end{enumerate}

Consistency' is ensured because, by definition of quorum, regardless of what faulty processes do, an effective quorum of $p_i$ is a superset of a quorum of $p_i$.
Availability' is ensured because, by $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$, in every fail-compatible execution, $p_i$ has an exclusively well-behaved quorum $Q$ and, given sufficient communication, $p_i$ learns about $Q$.

\section{Systems with Befouled Processes}

Here we consider the more general situation in which $Q^3$ holds only for particular subsets of the system.

\section{Related Work}

Hirt and Maurer~\cite{hirtPlayerSimulationGeneral2000} show that there exists a quorum system for $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if no three fail-prone sets cover the whole system; this property is called property $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$. Moreover, every fail-prone system that satisfies $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ determines a canonical quorum system $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ where $Q$ is a quorum if and only if $Q$ is the complement of a fail-prone set. %Thus, given a fail-prone systems satisfying $\mathcal{F}$, $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ is a natural quorum system to use.

Note that federated fail-prone systems generalize fail-prone systems: a fail-prone system $\mathcal{F}$ corresponds to a federated fail-prone system $\mathbb{F}$ where, for every process $p_i$, $T_i=\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{F}_i=\mathcal{F}$.
Moreover, if we ignore quorums that contain different quorums (which makes sense in practice), the corresponding canonical quorum systems are isomorphic: in $\overline{\mathbb{F}}$, every process has the same set of quorums, and $Q$ is a quorum (that does not contain a different quorum) if and only if there is a fail-prone set $F\in\mathcal{F}$ such that $Q=\mathcal{P}\setminus F$.

\note{Note that federated fail-prone systems do not seem to generalize the asymmetric fail-prone systems of Cachin and Tackmann~\cite{cachinAsymmetricDistributedTrust2019}. However, interestingly, $Q^3$ seems to generalize.}

Cachin and Tackmann generalize fail-prone systems to asymmetric fail-prone systems, where each process makes its own assumptions about which processes may fail together.
An asymmetric fail-prone system is an array of fail-prone systems $\mathbb{F}=\left[\mathcal{F}_1,...,\mathcal{F}_n\right]$ where $\mathcal{F}_i$ is a fail-prone system denoting the assumptions of process $p_i$.  Similarly to Hirt and Maurer, Cachin and Tackman define an asymmetric quorum system for $\mathbb{F}$, they generalize property $Q^3$ to asymmetric quorum systems, and they show that (a) $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ holds if and only if there exists an asymmetric quorum system for $\mathbb{F}$ and (b) an asymmetric fail-prone system determines a canonical asymmetric quorum system for $\mathbb{F}$.

% as follows: $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ holds if and only if for every two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$, for every $F_i^1, F_i^2\in \mathcal{F}_i$, $F_j^1, F_j^2\in \mathcal{F}_j$, $F_i^1\cup F_j^1\cup \left(F_i^2\cap F_j^2\right)$ do not cover the whole set.

The property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ of Cachin and Tackmann stipulates that for every two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$, for every two fail-prone sets $F_i^1$ and $F_i^2$ of $p_i$, for every two fail-prone sets $F_j^1$ and $F_j^2$ of $p_j$, we must have $\mathcal{P}\not\subseteq F_i^1\cup F_j^1\cup \left(F_i^2\cap F_j^2\right)$. Thus, unless every two processes in the system make compatible assumptions, in the sense of satisfying property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$, it is not possible to obtain an asymmetric quorum system that tolerates failures within the bounds of the failure assumptions made by the processes. In practice, it is unclear to us whether there exists a pragmatic scheme to achieve Cachin and Tackmann's property $Q^3(\mathbb{F})$ in a permissionless network.

% Similarly, an asymmetric quorum system is a family of quorum systems $\mathbb{Q}=\left[\mathcal{Q}_1,...,\mathcal{Q}_n\right]$ where $\mathcal{Q}_i$ is the quorum system of process $p_i$. $\mathbb{Q}$ must be such that (a) for every two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$ and for every two quorums $Q_i$ of $p_i$ and $Q_j$ of $p_j$, $Q_i\cap Q_j$ contains a process which is not assumed faulty by both $p_i$ and $p_j$ (i.e. for every $F\in F_i$ and $F'\in F_j$, $Q_i\cap Q_j \not\subseteq F\cap F'$\todo{this is not the wording of Cachin, which seems confusing}), and (b) for every set of processes $F$ that $p_i$ assume may fail together, there is a quorum of $p_i$ that is disjoint from $F$. As in the case of traditional quorum systems, those conditions enable solving useful distributed computing tasks such as read-write registers and broadcast using well-known techniques. Moreover, Cachin and Tackmann show that property $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ generalizes to asymmetric quorum systems as follows: $Q^3(\mathcal{F})$ holds if and only if for every two processes $p_i$ and $p_j$,
